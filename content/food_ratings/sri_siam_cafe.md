Sri Siam Cafe is the best Thai restaurant in the Valley. Everything is solid but some top choices are:
## Crispy Rice Salad
Deep-fried grains of rice mixed with Thai sour sausage, dressed with lime and chilis and served with romaine lettuce. Similar to larb, this dish originates from Laos (In Lao restaurants it will be called Nam Khao), but it is much less commonplace in Thai restaurants than larb - I don't know of any other Thai restaurant that serves it. Sri Siam Cafe's crispy rice salad has a much different flavor profile from the Nam Khao found in Lao restaurants: the crispiness of the rice combines with the crunch of the lettuce for an incredible textural experience, and its richness is contrasted beautifully by the sourness of the sausage and lime. I would consider it to be a unique offering within LA.

You can also get it with chicken or tofu.

## Khao Soi
A Northern Thai yellow curry noodle soup for those unfamiliar. Not every Thai restaurant has khao soi. Not every Thai restaurant that has khao soi has a good khao soi. Sri Siam Cafe has a phenomenal khao soi.
