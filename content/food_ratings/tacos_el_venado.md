The home territory taco stand and undisputed GOAT of tacos al pastor. Top recs:

## Tacos Al Pastor
Obviously. Comes with pineapple.
## My top taco rotation
Suadero, tripas, cabeza, and al pastor. I think in this rotation the key is to follow the tripas with cabeza and let the unctiousness cut that intensity.
## Alambre Desmadre
Esentially fajitas with cheese. Desmadre - all the meats. Comes with tortillas.
# Loaded Potato
# Cali Burrito
# Tortas

# Note on other locations and Angel's Tacos
TLV has two other locations: 6315 Sepulveda Blvd in Van Nuys, and 6th and Vermont in Koreatown. Both are smaller and get less traffic than the NoHo location.

Angel's Tacos is a set of stands run by the son of the TLV founder, who now also runs TLV since his father retired. They have the same al pastor. Angel's is more expensive and has a smaller selection of meats, but to make up for it they have tortillas hechas a mano. They have several locations, which can be found on their [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/angelstijuanatacos).

Do not sleep on the smaller locations - due to lower traffic, you can often get bits of al pastor that are especially browned from the trompo. For this reason I actually prefer the smaller locations for al pastor specifically.
