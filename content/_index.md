# Research Statement

My research interest is in representation learning for computer vision or computational imaging. In particular, I am interested in investigating the following questions: 
- How do the statistical, geometric, and topological properties of learned representations and representation spaces affect the performance and generalizability of vision models, especially in out-of-distribution generalization, adversarial robustness, transfer learning, and equitable model impacts?
- How can we influence these properties to create robust representation spaces?
- How can we apply these insights to solve real-world problems such as climate forecasting, autonomous navigation, and fairness in generative AI?
