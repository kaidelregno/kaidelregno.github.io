I am an M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA performing research in the [Visual Machines Group](https://visual.ee.ucla.edu) with Professor Achuta Kadambi. I am interested in computer vision, computational imaging, and generative AI. I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from UCLA in 2023.
